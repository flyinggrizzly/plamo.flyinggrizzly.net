- # [[MG Barbatos]] painting plan updates
	- In general, I was finding some of the pure colors too poppy and saturated, so this update is mostly about toning that down with undercoating and integrating more of the desaturated blues and reds in [[Mr Color/131 Propeller Color (slightly reddish brown)]] and [[Mr Color/125 Cowling Color (almost black blue)]]
	- Yellow: the brass ([[Mr Color/Metal Color/219 Brass]]) was looking a little out of place next to the gritty white, so I'm going back to [[Mr Color/58 Orange Yellow]], but this time undercoating it with [[Mr Color/131 Propeller Color (slightly reddish brown)]]. I'm hoping that resolves the issue I had before with the orange yellow being too bright next to the dark undercoated white.
	- Blue black: I ended up using the same [[Mr Color/40 German Gray]] from the cables for these instead of [[Mr Color/125 Cowling Color (almost black blue)]], since it's mixing in with [[Mr Color/37 RLM 75 Gray Violet]] and who knows what else in [[lacquer dish/01 black gray]]
	- Blue (new entry): undercoated with [[Mr Color/131 Propeller Color (slightly reddish brown)]], and will paint with probably a mix of [[Mr Color/GX/5 Susie Blue]] and [[Mr Color/125 Cowling Color (almost black blue)]] to darken it. Plus maybe some [[Mr Color/GX/114 Super Clear Flat]] to flat it out
	- Red: I had started with a rough brush of straight [[Mr Color/GX/3 Red]], but it was again... like the orange yellow,too bright. So I've recoated it with [[Mr Color/125 Cowling Color (almost black blue)]] and will go over it with a mix of [[Mr Color/GX/3 Red]] plus maybe some [[Mr Color/131 Propeller Color (slightly reddish brown)]] later
