- # Progress painting [[MG Barbatos]]
	- based the second leg's inner frame in [[Mr Color/GX/3 Red]]. Will hit it with [[Gaia Notes/125 Star Bright Iron]] probably tomorrow
	- painted the red elements (feet, chin, hip bits) in a mix of [[Mr Color/GX/3 Red]] and [[Mr Color/131 Propeller Color (slightly reddish brown)]], out of [[lacquer dish/02 red-orange]]. These were undercoated before with [[Mr Color/125 Cowling Color (almost black blue)]]
	- painted the blue sections with [[Gaia Notes/Dougram/CB 15 Cobalt Blue]], with a tiny dot of [[Mr Color/125 Cowling Color (almost black blue)]] in [[lacquer dish/3 blue]] which previously had some [[Mr Color/GX/5 Susie Blue]]. These were undercoated already in [[Mr Color/131 Propeller Color (slightly reddish brown)]]
	- painted yellow sections (grills) with a mix of [[Mr Color/58 Orange Yellow]]  and [[Gaia Notes/005 Sunshine Yellow]] out of [[lacquer dish/4 warm yellow]], which looks like it had a bit of the [[Mr Color/58 Orange Yellow]] in it already. Yellow parts were undercoated with [[Mr Color/131 Propeller Color (slightly reddish brown)]] to give them some depth. I did about 3 coats by brush, then finished with the airbrush since I need to get coverage without too much thickness of the paint
